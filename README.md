# Sorting algorithms & Big O
General understandings of this projects are
- To create least four different sorting algorithms
- know what is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
- knowing how to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- understand What is a stable sorting algorithm


Project done by Arnold and Loise :)
